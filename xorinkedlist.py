"""
XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list.

Instead of each node holding next and prev, it holds a field named both which is an XOR of the next node and the previous.

Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element at the end and
get(index) return the node at index.
